# 7-Segment Counter with Jetson Nano

This project was developed for the **EEE 313 - Introduction to Embedded Systems** course. It demonstrates a simple up/down counter using a **Common Cathode 7-Segment Display** and **two buttons**, controlled by an **NVIDIA Jetson Nano**.

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to:
- Increment a counter from **0 to 9** when the **UP button** is pressed
- Decrement the counter from **9 to 0** when the **DOWN button** is pressed
- Display the current count on a 7-segment display

## ‚öôÔ∏è Software Setup

- **IDE**: Thonny
- **Language**: Python 3
- **Library**: Jetson.GPIO

---

## Code Overview

The core functionality is implemented in [`Code.py`](Code.py):

- `changeNumber()` updates the 7-segment display according to the counter
- The main loop detects button presses and updates the counter value
- Segment logic ensures only one digit is shown at a time
- `GPIO.cleanup()` ensures safe GPIO state reset on exit
